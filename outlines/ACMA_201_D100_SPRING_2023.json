    "courseDetails": "<br /><strong>Course Outline:</strong><br /><br />This course is an introduction to financial mathematics. The material covered is useful for everyday applications involving sequences of predetermined (non-contingent) payments, such as loans, mortgages, annuities and fixed income investments. It is also fundamental to working with more complex, contingent cash flows in actuarial practice (pricing, reserving, asset-liability management and capital budgeting). Topics include:<br /><br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Measurement of Interest:</strong> Simple interest, compound interest, accumulation functions, present value, effective and nominal rates, force of interest, inflation, real rates, determinants of interest rates.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Equations of value:</strong> Basic problem, unknown time, unknown rate of interest.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Basic Annuities:</strong> Immediate, due, perpetuities.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>General Annuities:</strong> Payments at a different frequency than interest is convertible, continuous annuities, varying annuities.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Yield Rates:</strong> Cash flow analysis, reinvestment rate, rates of return.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Amortization Schedules:</strong> Principal and interest payments, outstanding loan balance, varying series of payments, continuous payments.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Bonds and Other Securities:</strong> Types of securities, price of a bond, premium and discount, yield rates.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><strong>Other:</strong> Yield curves, forward rates, spot rates, duration, convexity, immunization, interest rate swaps.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<div id=\"x_divtagdefaultwrapper\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<div>\r\n<p><strong><em>This course is accredited under the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) University Accreditation Program (UAP).
