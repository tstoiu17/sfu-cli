    "description": "The basics of embedded system organization, hardware-software co-design, and programmable chip technologies are studied. Formal models and specification languages for capturing and analyzing the behavior of embedded systems. The design and use of tools for system partitioning and hardware/software co-design implementation, validation, and verification are also studied.",

Check out the site for more information and videos that help explain the issues in plain English.</p>\r\n<p>Each student is responsible for his or her conduct as it affects the university community. Academic dishonesty, in whatever form, is ultimately destructive of the values of the university. Furthermore, it is unfair and discouraging to the majority of students who pursue their studies honestly. Scholarly integrity is required of all members of the university. <a href=\"http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html\">http://www.sfu.ca/policies/gazette/student/s10-01.html</a></p>",

    "courseDetails": "You will gain hands-on experience developing embedded applications on your own 32-bit single board computer (BeagleBone Green). You will purchase this hardware through the school during the first week of class instead of buying a required textbook (at similar in cost to a textbook). By the end of the course, you will be able to setup and use a Linux build environment to develop embedded Linux applications. You will have learned bare-metal development (no OS), Linux device driver creation, and be able to read basic hardware circuits. You will have demonstrated a mastery of embedded development on the course group project by implementing a stand-alone product or by interfacing with a larger system. The assignments and project require a significant amount of time to complete. Expect to spend more time on this course than a less hands-on course.<br /><br />Topics<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Embedded C and/or C++ programming.</li>\r\n<li>Embedded Linux cross-platform application development.</li>\r\n<li>Controlling external hardware via Linux applications.</li>\r\n<li>Embedded application testing and cross-platform debugging.</li>\r\n<li>Linux device driver development.</li>\r\n<li>Bare metal embedded development (no OS) and low-level device control.</li>\r\n<li>Understand basic hardware circuits.</li>\r\n<li>Realtime embedded applications.</li>\r\n</ul>",
